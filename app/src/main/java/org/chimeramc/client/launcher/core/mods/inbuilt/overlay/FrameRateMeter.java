/**
 * A host-side frame-rate meter.
 *
 * <p>The inbuilt native {@code FpsMod} only reports a value when its hook resolves a game address,
 * which does not happen on every build — so the FPS overlay could sit on "FPS: --" forever. This
 * meter counts the display's own vsync callbacks through {@link Choreographer}, which needs no
 * native hook and works on any build the launcher runs on.
 *
 * <p><b>What the number means.</b> This is the host's present rate, i.e. the rate the game's
 * frames are being delivered to the display on this process, not an internal game counter. It is
 * the honest reading available without a native feed; the overlay's own label does not claim more.
 *
 * <p>Allocation-free on the frame path: a fixed ring of frame timestamps and a rolling one-second
 * window. {@link #post()} must be called from the main thread; the callback re-arms itself while
 * the meter is running.
