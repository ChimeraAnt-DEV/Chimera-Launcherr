/**
 * The Offhand button: opens the inventory so an allowed item can go in the off-hand slot, and/or
 * uses the off-hand item.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this opens the inventory rather than "swapping".</b> Bedrock Edition has no swap-to-off-
 * hand key at all — there is no {@code key.offhand} in the shipped input map, so Java's {@code F}
 * swap simply does not exist here. The off-hand slot is filled from the inventory screen and accepts
 * only a handful of items (shields, arrows, firework rockets, totems of undying, maps and nautilus
 * shells). The working action is therefore to open the inventory ({@code key.inventory}, {@code E})
 * and let the player place an allowed item, which is what the module's primary key now sends.
 *
 * <p>It injects the game's own keys through {@link MoreButtonsMod#sendKey}, the same native
 * key-injection path the working on-screen button modules use (Quick Drop, Toggle HUD, Hotbar Slot).
 * A key that only reached {@code Activity.dispatchKeyEvent} is not seen by the game's input loop,
 * which is why an earlier version of this module did nothing at all. The path is key-level, so it
 * behaves identically in a local world, a Realm and a large server such as The Hive.
 *
 * <p>The hardware keybind mirrors the button so a keyboard/controller player can trigger the same
 * action without the on-screen control.
