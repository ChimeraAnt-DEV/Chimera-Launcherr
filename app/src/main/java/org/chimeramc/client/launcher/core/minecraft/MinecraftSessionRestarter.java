/**
 * Relaunches the running Minecraft instance so a change that needs a fresh load takes effect.
 *
 * <p>The in-game pack changer can write the pack lists, but this build has no verified native
 * in-place refresh (the preloader's {@code nativeReloadResourcePacks} resolves to no hook on the
 * shipped builds and returns false), so the
 * loaded world keeps its cached pack stack. The supported way to apply it is to relaunch the same
 * instance — which is exactly what the launcher's Play button does — without the player having to
 * back out to the launcher and find it again.
 *
 * <p>The relaunch reuses the launcher's own validated launch path rather than reimplementing it:
 * {@link MinecraftProcessRestarter#restartLauncherAfterMinecraftExit} shows the restart screen,
 * kills the game process (releasing the game's file locks and its cached state), reopens
 * {@code MainActivity} and then re-runs the launch for the selected instance. Rebuilding an
 * Activity or process death alone would not work: {@code MinecraftActivity.onCreate} rebuilds the
 * game from its storage directories, and reusing the live process leaves the already-loaded native
 * libraries and cached pack stack in place.
 *
 * <p>Called from the in-game overlay, on the game's own thread. The relaunch is posted so the
 * toggle handler returns before the game tears down.
