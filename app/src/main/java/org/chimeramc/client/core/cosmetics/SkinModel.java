/**
 * Geometry for a Minecraft player model: the six boxes, the texture region for each face, and
 * the isometric projection that turns a box corner into a screen point.
 *
 * <p>This is the pure half of the character preview. It carries no Android types, so the model
 * layout, the UV table and the visible-face test are all unit-testable — which matters because a
 * wrong UV is invisible until it is rendered against a real skin, and a wrong visible-face test
 * silently drops a side of the head.
 *
 * <p>Units are skin-model pixels (the player is 32 px tall for 1.8 blocks, so one pixel is
 * 0.05625 blocks). The origin sits between the feet, so y grows upward and x/z are centred.
 *
 * <p>Scope: only the base layer plus the head's hat overlay are composited. The remaining
 * second-layer regions are not drawn; a skin that relies entirely on an overlay for its
 * appearance will look like its base layer. That is stated in the cosmetics UI rather than
 * papered over with guessed UVs.
