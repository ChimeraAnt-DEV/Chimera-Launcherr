/**
 * The Replay tab's control contract, shared by both screens.
 *
 * <p>The spec fixes two input maps, and they are the same on Screen A and Screen B because the tab
 * is one feature with one backend:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Controller — A select, X delete, Y favorite, L1/R1 cycle clips.</li>
 *   <li>KBM — click select, Del delete, Space play/pause, arrows scrub.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pure: it maps a raw key code to an action and never touches the UI, so both screens route
 * through one table and a change to the mapping cannot land on only one of them.
